# Shrunklock
## Shrunklock is a shortened version of Sherlock. When I first saw Sherlock I thought, "This is a great tool but it takes up a lot of space so why not create a smaller version." I ended up making Shrunklock which is a portable version of Sherlock compressed into one file. Below are the instructions on how to install the program
